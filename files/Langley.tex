Here is a problem that looks like it will be easy, and then turns out, famously, to be hard.  Let's take a look.
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {Langley_1.png} \end{center}

Using theorems about supplementary and vertical angles, and triangle sums, we can fill in some of the values:
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {Langley_2.png} \end{center}

However, we're not any closer to $x$.  One idea is to use algebra:
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {Langley_3.png} \end{center}

So now we can use the triangle sum of angles theorem to write some equations:
\[ a + x = 140 \]
\[ a + b = 160 \]
\[ b + c = 130 \]
\[ c + x = 110 \]

Four equations in four unknowns.  That could work.  However, subtract the first from the last and the second from the third to obtain:
\[ a - c = 30 \]
\[ a - c = 30 \]

In linear algebra, we call that degenerate.  The system is not independent and we cannot solve it.

However, we notice some isosceles triangles.  I found three:

This will bring us to the "bright idea."

We pick another point on one of the sides and draw the two line segments so that the angle labeled at the top is $40^\circ$. 
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {Langley_6.png} \end{center}

So then we can do some geometry.  First of all, the total angle at vertex $A$ is 80.  Therefore, the angle $DAE$ is 20.  Since the angle at vertex $D$ is 80, $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles and $AD = AE$.

We already knew that $\triangle ABD$ is isosceles, so $AD = AB$.  Thus, $AE = AB$.  So now $\triangle ABE$ is isosceles, and since angle $BAE$ is 60, the triangle is also equilateral.  So $BE = AE = AB$.

By equal base angles $\triangle ACE$ is isosceles, so $AE = EC$.

By adding up angles, we can find that angle $BEC$ equals 40.  Since $\triangle BEC$ is isosceles, $x + 40 = (1/2) 140 = 70$ and then $x = 30$.

There is a lot more.
